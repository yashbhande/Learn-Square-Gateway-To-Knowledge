**Quick Start Guide**

Hey there! Thanks for snagging our project! Below are the simple steps to get it up and running on your computer:

1. **Get the Project:**
   - Hit the "Download ZIP" button on our project's page.
   - Unzip the downloaded file wherever you like on your computer.

2. **Drop it in htdocs:**
   - Now, find where you installed XAMPP. 
   - Look for a folder called "htdocs" inside there.
   - Drag the unzipped project folder right into that "htdocs" folder.

3. **Bring in the Database:**
   - Inside the project folder, you'll find a file that ends with `.sql` in a folder named something like "database" or "db_dump".
   - Start up XAMPP by clicking on its icon.
   - Make sure both Apache and MySQL are lit up green.
   - Pop open your web browser and go to `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`.
   - Log in using your usual MySQL username and password.
   - Create a new database named "course_db".
   - Click on that "course_db" from the menu on the left.
   - Hit up the "Import" tab at the top.
   - Select the `.sql` file you found earlier and hit "Go" to import it.

4. **Fire it Up:**
   - Now, open your web browser.
   - In the address bar, type in `http://localhost/your_project_folder_name`, but replace "your_project_folder_name" with whatever you named the project folder in htdocs.
   - Press Enter, and you should see the project come to life!

**Just a heads-up:** Keep your XAMPP running while you're messing with the project.

That's it! You're all set to dive into our project. If you've got any questions or run into any snags, just give us a shout.
